								<h2>Women make us better - TWEET & Instagram</h2>

							<p>For this year's International Women in Engineering Day, which is held annually on June 23 by the Women’s Engineering Society in the UK with Patronage from UNESCO, we highlight the need for more women to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) careers by reflecting on the challenges women have historically faced seeking higher education in these areas and promoting paths to success for the next generation of female innovators.</p>

							<p>Our <strong>#WomenMakeUsBetter</strong> video features Boeing engineers reading and reacting to the college rejection letters women received in the early years of the 20th century. While we’ve come a long way since that time, we believe there is still much more to be done to increase the number of women in engineering.</p>
